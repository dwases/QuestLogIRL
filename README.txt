A personal Quest Log for custom quests made using ImGui for Windows systems with DirectX 11.
Includes the ability to add your own quests and mark them as complete or failed.
Moreover, the program will remember distinct users, so that everyone can see their quests and only their quests.

How to run:
Enter imgui-master/examples/example_win32_directx/Release/ and double-click example_win32_directx11.exe.
You can either create your account by registering or use the account with following info:(username: user1 , password: password1) to see a ready account presenting features of the application
Registering with data including white characters might not work(you have been warned).

A note for recruiters:
My code is in main.cpp file. The remaining files are required for ImGui, DirectX 11 and win32 to work or store user, quest and temporary data.
